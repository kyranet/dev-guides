# Your first language

As in real world, we start communicating with each other via the [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language), however, we cannot talk with our machines in English, we need something, called [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). Differences? A few. A programming language is a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) that specifies what the machine should do, they are **set of rules**. However, not all programming languages are equal, nor have the same purposes, for example, in web browsers, you are currently reading a book, which content is contained in a structured [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) page, stylized by [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), and, [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) which runs the scripts needed for the website to work and display the information correctly. We are using three very different languages just to read this book, there is no way you can make a website with only one of them (you can make HTML-only websites, but their presentation is pretty poor without the style sheets).

## Programming languages

- **JavaScript** is a widely used with coverage in almost every browser. It is a dynamic, [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [event driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) language, it runs the front-end scripts from almost every website in the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). Nowadays, thanks to [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), you can also run JavaScript in the back-end. Example of Hello World:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

- **Python** is a widely used and powerful [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) language. Nowadays it is widely used for machine learning and videogame development, but it is also used for science due to its powerful math calculation. Example of Hello World:

```python
print('Hello World!');
```
