## Introduction

So you're into programming or development of something? Thats awesome! We really want you to succeed with your projects and keep your interests! Even if you know nothing about programming or even just a tiny bit, you're more than welcome here. The world is in need of new developers and programmers. If you can master just a tiny bit of programming, you're already in the "cool kids club" that companies are looking for. The starting path is hard and you might feel alone and intimidated by all the new information swirling around in your head. Trust me, we have all been there at some point. As said, we want you to succeed, and therefore we want this book to be your friend and help you as you're getting started.

The world of developers might be scary for you, do not worry, it was once for most of us, but at the same time, our curiosity makes us develop new things, what you can do in this world is limited only by your imagination, **you** are the creator, and that's such an amazing experience.

There is probably nothing we can do to express what we feel when we make our first [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) drawing pyramids, or games, such as the [snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)), even a basic websites, that is the success, something we love.

First, we need to overtake the _developer world's threshold_, what is is? It is a little barrier that separates the real and the virtual worlds.

What is the difference? While the real world may be **chaotic**, every statement you write in the 'virtual' world is **mathematically perfect** as it is ruled by machines, and machines are logical. Don't be scared about the word "math" in the previous sentence, because you write the code, and your machine executes it as in, the maths are inside and interpreted/calculated by it, not by you. Let's take the following JavaScript example:

```javascript
const message = 'Hello!';

if (message === 'Hello!')
    console.log('Hello dear user! Nice to meet you!');
```

As you see in the code above, I have defined a constant called `message`, which content or value is `Hello!`. So when you try to access to the constant `message`, you will receive the value you have assigned it. Then, you check **if** the value of the constant `message` is `Hello!`. Yeah, it is! In that case, it'll execute the following line:

```javascript
console.log('Hello dear user! Nice to meet you!');
```

Which outputs in your console with the content inside it. Obviously, this changes in other languages, but the logic is always the same. That is what I mean with mathematically perfect, there is no noise that could make the machine misinterpret your code.
